description: A list of articles that I think are great on LWN

# Why
LWN.net has a lot of really well-written articles, and I've been collating some great articles for people at different skill levels. The initial inspiration for this was to find articles for an operating systems class I was tutoring.


## Introductory Articles
- [Ulrich Drepper's 7-part series on what every programmer should know about memory](https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/)


## Intermediate-Level
- [Variable-length arrays, pros and cons](https://lwn.net/Articles/749064/)
- [What if we we used really large pages (> 1 MB) versus the smaller page sizes that we normally use?](https://lwn.net/Articles/374424/])
- [How can we get more fine-grained security than just having read/write/execute permissions for files? Could we restrict particular applications to only access certain directories?](https://lwn.net/Articles/767137/). See also: the pledge() syscall.
- [System calls are slow since we need to switch to the OS: can we allow certain syscalls to be implemented in user-space memory? (vDSO)](https://lwn.net/Articles/615809/)
- [How does a program get run?](https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/)
