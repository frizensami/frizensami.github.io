# Looking back on the process of developing and publishing research: Lidarphone

## What is this?

As I write this, it's been just over a year since we published our paper on [_Lidarphone_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3384419.3430781){:target="\_blank"} (full text available [here](/research){:target="\_blank"}). We discovered that LIDAR sensors (such as those on robot vacuum cleaners and self-driving cars) can be hijacked as covert microphones to eavesdrop on conversations.

Most research efforts don't make it into the twelve compressed pages worth of research paper. This can make research look effortless. How did the authors think of X then Y? Did they somehow hit correct insight after insight til the end?

I know this contributes to my imposter syndrome, and I expect many others as well.

That's why I want to **describe the entire process, ups and downs included, of creating this one research paper** on Lidarphone. Hopefully, this provides one realistic perspective to help anyone who needs it.

#### A short disclaimers section

-   This experience is only a single perspective, which I hope is even a _little_ relatable.
-   It will **not** represent even a fraction of the difficulty of other fields.
-   This at most represents one specific subfield in computer science
-   In stark contrast, for the physical sciences, a single paper could takes many years from inception to publication.

## Coming up with the problem

-   hammer, nail
-   personal interest, advisor

## Feasibility studies

-   cost
-   cycles of failure and success

## Misguided attempts

-   reverse engineering

## Getting external help

-   Hash, XV-11, writing emails

## Start of the pandemic

-   Experimental setup indoors
-   Playing loud sounds
