# Why

I've worked on some interesting projects over the years, and I didn't find my GitHub README and docs to be the best place to list down all the design choices and interesting problems along the way for each project.

# Backlog

- Tembusu Vertical Marathon controller
- Work at Hope Technik (Multi Aircraft + Synchronized Ground Control Station)
- Attempt to make an automatic timetable arranging system for NUSMods
- Work at Yonah over 2 years
- Automatic Washing Machine status detection saga at Tembusu College
- Haskell Optimization project
- Previous research work at A*STAR
- More I haven't remembered yet
