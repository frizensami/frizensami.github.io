<h3> Overview </h3>
<section>
	I am a Lecturer at the National University of Singapore's Computer Science Department.
</section>

<br />

<section>
	Before, I was a <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/tutorship/"><strong>Graduate Tutor</strong></a> (a full-time teaching role) for more than five years while pursuing my PhD. 
	<br />
	<br />
	Before even that, I was an undergraduate teaching assistant, and I had such a good experience that I decided to pursue teaching as a career :)
	<br />
	<br />


<h3> Courses </h3>

	In the Computer Science department, I focus on <em> systems and high-performance computing </em> courses such as:
	<ul>
		<li> <strong> CS2106: Introduction to Operating Systems </strong> </li>
		<li> <strong> CS3210: Parallel Computing </strong> </li>
		<li> <strong> CS3211: Parallel and Concurrent Programming </strong> </li>
	</ul>

	I also teach <em> introductory Computer Engineering </em> courses, such as:
	<ul>
		<li> <strong> CS1010: Programming Methodology </strong> (using the C programming language) </li>
		<li> <strong> CG1111A: Engineering Principles and Practice I </strong> (building and understanding fundamental electronic circuits) </li>
		<li> <strong> CG2111A: Engineering Principles and Practice II </strong> (microcontroller programming and end-to-end system implementation)</li>
	</ul>

	However I have also taught <em> security </em> courses in the past, such as <strong> CS2107: Introduction to Information Security </strong>
    <br /> <br />


	These focuses are in line with my <a href="/research/">research</a> on sensors (a signals, systems, and
	hardware/electronics-heavy area) and their security implications.
