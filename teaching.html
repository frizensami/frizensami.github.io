<h3> Overview </h3>
<section>
	Since 2019, I have been a <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/phdis/tutorship/"><strong>Graduate Tutor</strong></a> (and concurrently, a PhD student) at the National University of Singapore's Computer Science Department.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Before this, I was an undergraduate TA, and I had such a good experience that I decided to pursue teaching :) <br/> <br/>

	I focus primarily on (and have taught) <em> systems </em> modules such as:
	<ul>
		<li> <strong> CS2106: Introduction to Operating Systems </strong> </li>
		<li> <strong> CS3210: Parallel Computing </strong> </li>
		<li> <strong> CS3211: Parallel and Concurrent Programming </strong> </li>
	</ul>

	However I have also taught <em> security </em> modules in the past, such as:

	<ul>
		<li> <strong> CS2107: Introduction to Information Security </strong> </li>
	</ul>

	This focus is in line with my <a href="/research/">research</a> on sensors (a systems-heavy area) and their security implications.
